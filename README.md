## Failure to Launch - Real Estate CRYPTO

The race is on for the first cryptocurrency backed up by tangible assets or something with value. Most early crypto startups went into the gold backing while some preferred oil and other commodities. LATOKEN deep dives into the world of real estate. Headquartered in London, England, the company was meticulously administered by three founding fathers. The company was incorporated on 2017 by Valentin Preobrazhensky (CEO) together with Danila Simonov (CTO), Roman Zhdanov (Managing Director) and Denis Simagin (Managing Director). The company was conceptualized in Estonia hence, the nick name Estonia based cryptocurrency was originated. LATOKEN received funding of around $18M from their ICO.
<br>

Emerging markets are always interested in real estate loan investment, but the purchase process demands a plethora of minutiae that derails the transaction. Real estate needs investors but not just an ordinary investor. For real estate to thrive, a group of global deep-pocket investors are of greatest importance. Emerging markets are a force to be reckoned with, yet these groups are being denied access due to the antiquated structures of the real estate financing world. Participants of the emerging markets are not monolithic as they are constantly looking for avenue to invest with. The CEO of LATOKEN was able to observe the efforts of emerging market investors and how they suffer going through the bottleneck. Valentin Preobrazhensky was an experienced hedge funds manager when he discovered that emerging markets have a minimal participation of low home loans due to ambiguity towards investors and the exorbitant costs of deals. Preobrazhensky came up with a strategic plan for home equity lenders which eventually lowered their barriers of entry.

## Background

Real estate is a people business and has not dropped out of the conversation. Alexander Pope, an English poet once mentioned “To Err is Human.” Hence, the historical bottleneck in real estate loan financing occurred and will just keep on menacing the system until someone jumps in and puts an end to it. Another facet of the problem is that raising finance for new real estate projects is somewhat difficult. Crowd financing is unimaginable for startups to administer, especially if they deal only with single sources of loan providers who can trap them with excessive high interest charges. 	The author of this case study is indeed fascinated in creating a cryptocurrency back up by real estate as there is no doubt it is one of the most stable of asset appreciation. Dissecting the past and future of LATOKEN being one of the first startups to venture in real estate tokenization would be a great step in formulating the most desirable cryptocurrency ever created. Lessons from their past blind spots will catapult into the most beneficial future of blockchain technology.
<br>

LATOKEN started with a mission to serve as a real asset trading platform but gradually started deviating to multi-asset and ended up mostly dealing with virtual asset trading. They brag as the first to tokenize the real estate and virtual assets and trade on the exchange. LATOKEN ambitiously tried to tokenize the shares of blue-chip companies to no avail. Burdensome regulation and lack of funding may have stalled their vision. LATOKEN did so great at the start; their platform includes a launchpad for startups to conduct their ICO. So far, no trading history occurred despite the huge number of registered users. Although they failed to deliver some of their promising features, LATOKEN was considered among the top exchanges. Their recent Market Cap goes to $12,976,169; 24 Volume of $33,021 with a circulating supply of 380,104,462 and a total supply of 400,000,000. The LATOKEN exchange conducted its initial coin offering in 2017 where it raised about 20 million USD by selling over 57 million LA tokens. Currently, about 380 million are in circulation. The LATOKEN is currently distributed to over 4,300 addresses with LATOKEN holding about 84% of the total distribution. They were always into sophistication as as their wallet alone is secured by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) algorithm to ensure security of databases and account passwords. LATOKEN has all the current security features of modern digital wallet systems to ensure that their assets will not be compromised. Their system is equipped with complete KYC and AML compliant. LATOKEN exchange has its own utility, the LA token, which is designed to facilitate transactions both as a quote currency and to settle transaction fees on the platform.
<br>

LATOKEN was so promising as they were on the frontline fully equipped with the Ethereum blockchain. Apparently, this new technology presents various practical solutions, including tokenization of real estate assets, process efficiency for underlying industry operations, reduced costs from process automation; access to global asset distribution, access to broader investor pools due to ownership fractionalization, access to secondary market opportunities, data accessibility to increase transparency and inform better investment decisions and portfolio management.
<br>

Their platform enhances liquidity and transparency of assets and reduces transaction costs. It provides cryptoholders with transparent price discovery and diversification across multiple asset classes as it allows the creation or listing of third-party asset tokens compliant with their disclosure and legal structure rules. LATOKEN allows asset owners to unlock the value of their assets and gain instant liquidity by creating asset token and selling them to cryptoholders with minimal transactions. LATOKEN is based on profitable home equity marketplace. The team has a strong track record in hedge fund management, development of marketplace, trading terminals and work at companies such as Avega Capital, McKinsey, BCG, Ernst & Young.
<br>

Blockchain simplifies access to alternative financing models by facilitating investor management for developers and ensuring investment transparency and continuous ROI tracking for investors. Blockchain based financial products can also be programmed for global distribution. These solutions simplify investor experience, increase investor confidence, and unlock access to a wider investor pool.
<br>

LATOKEN has a proven history on the exchange. The exchange has good liquidity and stands in the top 100 exchanges by daily trading volume. The user interface is well simplified for even newbies to quickly find their way around. The IEO success rate and exposure may attract prospects.
<br>

On the other side of the coin, LATOKEN has had a questionable asset being listed on the exchange that lowers their exchange reputation. Too much of the circulating supply of the LA token is held by the exchange. Poor support makes it difficult to trust that resolutions would be carried out promptly if users encounter problems. LATOKEN scam accusations suggesting wash trade can deter new users if volumes are misleading. Too many poor LATOKEN reviews are a huge deterring factor. There are no fiat gateways currently integrated with the exchange.
<br>

Despite the magnificent start, LATOKEN also battled some negative publicity issues. It is not a surprise for young rising superstars like LATOKEN to have some people scream that their projects are scams, especially when they fall short on their delivery. These gloomy pictures, however, invite stakeholders to review their risks. While searching for possible LATOKEN scam accusations, the most prevalent complaints came from users who had issues with customer support when transactions were wrong, especially due to deposit errors. Other users complained that LATOKEN listed scam projects, which perhaps questions the exchange’s due diligence. Although, after listing, some projects underperform and do not gain trading traction after a while; besides, there are numerous other factors to consider as prices of assets on an exchange decline.

## Evaluation of the Case

IBREA (International Blockchain Real Estate Association) believes that blockchain technology will be used by the real estate professionals and it will be much quicker than most imagine. Real estate owners and businesses who adopt blockchain earlier will experience the biggest benefit and will set themselves apart as leaders for the next revolution in the property industry. Despite the fact that the leadership of IBREA are the pioneers in this endeavor and are so optimistic that the mainstream will adopt its technology, they knew that it would take a while before the information technology expert would collaborate and connect the dots.
<br>

LATOKEN focuses on the tokenization of asset right from the start. They never focus on solving the issues brought by IBREA, in which keeping track of who owns what pieces of land is still a low-tech affair, involving mountains of hand-signed documents, envelopes, and couriers. That is, if a country is lucky enough to have a functioning land registry—the World Bank estimates that 70% of the world’s population lacks access to land titling. Getting everyone to agree on every stage of a property transaction, and to record it permanently somewhere, is a feat of security, coordination, and trust.
<br>

Luckily, a Swedish (Chroma Way) system started operating a private blockchain that has the land authority and others, like the banks, holding copies of the records. When a land title changes hands, each step of the process is verified and recorded on the blockchain. The system acts as a highly secure and transparent verification and storage service for property transactions, but it stops short of a full-blown cryptocurrency where land can be bought and sold as easily as a bitcoin. Chroma Ways’ smart contracts will facilitate a smoother and tamper-proof asset exchange process for the real estate market, thereby transforming the real estate transaction process into something more intuitive, less complicated, and with decreased costs.
<br>

Going back to the emerging markets, many foreigners who are interested in real estate investing encounter considerable difficulties, mainly in long-distance real estate negotiations. Depending on each jurisdiction (country, state or city), the purchase process demands massive layers of paper work that can quickly derail the transaction. Another burden is the gruesome details about the negotiations such as financing, security, regulations, and fees. In most cases, it is necessary to hire real estate professionals to analyze all documents to check any legal impediment, request debt clearance certificates, and prevent fraud.
<br>

Despite the importance of real estate for both society and individuals, there are many parts of the real estate transactions and the information about those transactions that take a long time to update. Many of these things are also based on outdated legislation. Information in the land registry can be missing because some part of the registration process has gone wrong. It usually takes a long time from when the purchasing contract is signed to when the bill of sale is signed, and the actual transfer of the property takes place.
<br>

To summarize some of the main issues to be addressed in the current process, we can highlight these problems: The Land Registration Office is only involved in a few steps at the end of the real estate transactions. As a consequence, the majority of the process is not transparent; in other words, visible to the public or other stakeholders. The system is slow at registering real estate transactions. The time between the signing a legally binding purchasing contract and when Land Registration Office receives the bill of sale and makes the approval of the title is often three to six months. The issues above have resulted in sellers, buyers, banks and real estate agents being forced to create their own complex processes for agreements, since they have to make sure that things can’t go wrong, and because the value of the transactions is large. This creates inefficiency. The Land Registration Office is continuously working on reducing the problems and weaknesses in its processes and systems. Blockchain technology provides the opportunity to solve many of these issues. In the long run, there is also great value if a solution can be developed and provide a framework and support for multiple government agencies where appropriate.

## Proposed Solution

The main objective of using blockchain technology in real estate is to make transactions more transparent via a peer-to peer system while also complying with the legalities for every country where the exchange of real estate assets takes place. With the rise of cryptocurrency value, crypto investors will be heading with more valuable assets. From furniture dealerships to Amazon sellers, they will be looking for more vendors of all types to start accepting digital coins as payment.  But the vendors are wise enough not to speculate on future value of cryptocurrency, and they often have the tendency to trade crypto back to cash.  This might put some downward pressure on digital coins prices and create a short-term bubble. However, expect a long-term rally the moment crypto becomes useful and viable.
<br>

IBREA provided us the clear path to embrace blockchain technology as the answer and to stop real estate nightmares. All the so-called FinTech experts have to do is connect the missing links. Chroma Way also created a list of step-by-step real estate procurement and possible innovations that will pave the way to automation:
<br>
<br>

TRANSACTION|PROPOSED SOLUTION
-----|-----
Property owner wants to sell a property.|Proposed solution: The property owner can check their ownership and verify themselves using the app from Land Registration Office.
The property owner, the Seller, contacts, a real estate agent and draws up an agreement for a real estate sale.|Proposed solution: The property owner, the Seller, contacts a real estate agent and commissions the agent to sell the property via the app. The agent accepts the offer to manage the sale of the property. In practice, the agent can also guide an individual through these steps in the app.
The agent contacts Land Registration Office and orders an excerpt from the property database to check the information about the property.|Proposed solution: Agents can see database as it should be readily available through the Land Registration App.
The agent puts the property up for sale and markets the property to potential buyers.|Proposed solution: Connecting with available MLS or starting a page of property listing would do it as part of an Ecosystem. 
The Buyer contacts a bank, the Buyer’s bank, and asks for a loan commitment. The bank checks the Buyer’s credit rating. The Buyer’s bank approves the loan commitment.|Proposed solution: Create a community of homeowners and buyers. Assist the participants to avail loans digitally.
The property is put out on display to the market and eventually offers are made.|Proposed solution: Part of the MLS ecosystem.
The Buyer who makes the highest offer makes an initial inquiry.|Proposed solution: Part of the MLS ecosystem.
The Buyer’s bank inspects the property and evaluates the credit options for the Buyer. The property and the Buyer may be inspected again in the respective databases.|Proposed solution: In the future, the property does not need to be questioned again because the latest information is always available and can otherwise be checked directly in the app.
The Bank approves the purchase price and the amount of the loan for the Buyer, which is often communicated over the phone.|Proposed solution: The Buyer’s bank can provide preliminary approval of the loan so that the agent and the Seller can be confident that the Buyer has the ability to pay
Prior to signing the purchasing contract, the agent again checks the Seller and the property with Land Registration Office. The agent also often checks that the Buyer actually has a loan commitment with the bank|Proposed solution: The Buyer’s bank is given access to the property via the app and the bank can check the property there. Information about the condition of the property, inspection report etc. can be included in the app or linked to the app
Often four copies of the contract are created, one for the Seller, one for the Buyer, one for the agent and one for the Buyer’s bank.|Proposed solution: The necessary information is registered in the app, e.g. date of possession and purchase price in digital fields, which reduces the risk of the contract being incorrectly formulated. Signatures are provided in the app. Everyone involved can retain a copy of the agreement and the verification record in the blockchain in their mobile phone or computer for extra security. The contract cannot be lost or falsified. If anyone wants to print out a paper copy, it is easy, but it is then just a copy that is only valid for the time when it is taken out. The contract is also shared with Land Registration Office, which registers the pending property title at no cost until the final verification record for the transfer (bill of sale) is distributed. The information about the purchase price and the property can be made public, which provides security for the Buyer and Seller and is important information for entities like national statistics bureau and central bank.
The contract is sent by the Buyer to the Buyer’s bank, often by regular mail.|Proposed solution: This step is obsolete as they can see the signed contract in the app and do not need to send it.
The bank sends credit documents to the Buyer, often via regular mail.|Proposed solution: The credit documents can be attached to the app and signed directly when the purchasing contract is written up. 
The Buyer signs the loan documents and also writes a payment order to the bank to pay a down payment into the agent’s escrow account.|Proposed solution: The Buyer can sign the loan documents as well as the payment order for the down payment directly with signatures in the app.
The Buyer sends the loan agreement to the Buyer’s bank via regular mail. The Buyer’s bank receives the loan documents and pays the down payment to the Agent.|Proposed solution: The loan documents do not need to be sent via regular mail because the bank gets a digitally signed copy of them directly when the purchasing contract is written.
The Buyer’s bank receives the loan documents and pays the down payment to the Agent.|Proposed solution: The bank can pay the down payment to the agent directly at the time of signing the contract, because the Buyer signs the payment order digitally.
If there is a condition that has to be met like an inspection of the property by the buyer, the property may be inspected by the Buyer.|Proposed solution: Connect with commercial digital viewing websites via API and local drone enthusiast. 
The agreement becomes binding if there were conditions in the form of inspection.|Proposed solution: Participating Inspection teams needs to get digitally bonded. They will be liable for any forms of fraud or misinformation. 
The agent pays the down payment to the Seller, while deducting the agent’s fees.|Proposed solution. Obsolete step due to the digital currency automation.
After this step, the main thing remaining is to actually sign the bill of sale, transfer the possession of the property and make the final payment. This is often done roughly 3 months after signing the purchasing contracts. During this time the mortgage deed transfers can be prepared and signed following the process for mortgage deeds described in that section of the report.|Proposed solution. IBREA have already created a digital form of deeds and it has been accepted in Chicago.
Closing: The agent rechecks the property and the Seller in the database of Land Registration Office to ensure that there are no problems that would prevent the sale the property.|Proposed solution: Obsolete step as the pending property title is already granted. If no changes have been made, this is displayed and the next stage can be processed without further changes or checks of the contract or real estate.
The Buyer and Seller sign the bill of sale at the agent’s office. The Buyer signs for the mortgage deed on the property|Proposed solution: This is done with digital signatures and digital identification. The risk of incorrect formulations in the bill of sale is minimized since the necessary information is already there and any new information is entered digitally and verified automatically.
The purchase price is paid by the Buyer’s bank to the Seller’s bank. Often this payment is made via a direct deposit where the Seller’s bank and the Buyer’s bank confirm that the transfer has been made.|Proposed solution: Obsolete step due to digital currency.
The Buyer, Seller, as well as the agent each save a copy of the contract and write one for the Buyer’s bank, and the Buyer may now take possession of the property.|Proposed solution: The contract is already available in the app. The copy also has a verification code that is registered in the blockchain.
The Buyer’s bank goes into the database of Land Registration Office and takes over mort-gage deed in the mortgage deed registry.|Proposed solution: With the mortgage deed application everyone involved in the mortgage deed transfer has already signed this contract. If and only if all requirements are fulfilled for the land title to be transferred to the owner will the mortgage deeds be transferred to the buyer’s bank.
The agent sends the Bill of sale to the Buyer’s bank|Proposed solution: The bill of sale and documentation for the mortgage on the property is already accessible to the bank via the app.
The Buyer’s bank sends the application for the property title along and a new mortgage (i.e. increase in the mortgage beyond the existing mortgage deeds) to Land Registrar.|Proposed solution: This information is already accessible and distributed.
Registering the property title: Land Registration Office grants The Buyer a Property title, and it is registered in the land registry.|Proposed solution: The pending property title is already granted and the process of verifying the agreement can proceed more quickly through automated decisions because the risk of incorrect formulations in the bill of sale is reduced when this is done using digital fields.
The Buyer’s bank is granted a new mortgage deed, which is registered in the mortgage deed system.|Proposed solution: Digitalize the Deeds.
Land Registrar decides on any service charges and stamp duty.|Proposed solution: Any possible charges will be anticipated and included on the Apps.
Land Registrar is paid via an automatic payment account for the title and the mortgage.|Proposed solution: Obsolete step due to digital currency.
Land Registration Office notifies the Buyer’s bank, i.e. the title applicant, by regular mail that the title has been granted.|Proposed solution: Land Registration Office record of the property title and the mortgage is shared via the app, tp wjere all parties can see that the title has been granted.
The Buyer’s bank notifies the Buyer that the title has been granted and the transaction is performed via regular mail.|Proposed solution: This step is obsolete as the information about the property title goes directly to the Buyer, Seller, agent, Buyer’s bank, and the Seller’s bank via the app.

Emerging market and local home loan investors have started looking at digital currencies and smart contracts as a new ecosystem. The winnings of savvy digital coin traders can eventually be converted into a real estate at the touch of a phone menu. Governments agencies, especially the Land Registrar, are now more involved in using the blockchain and smart contracts to finally digitize all government records. Consequently, this process no longer prevents foreign investors from proceeding with the transaction. Summarily, the real estate industry should operate within a shared database while still ensuring that each participant maintains a choice as to what property data will be shared and when. Thus, reinforcing a trust, but verify system.

## Recommendations
	
LATOKEN must focus first perfecting the tokenization process of real estate assets. Eventually, they can expand to different types of assets. So far, Leaxcoin is on the right track and apparently avoiding convolution. By doing so, it allows the entrepreneurs in emerging markets to benefit from a new generation of democratized and tokenized investments in private companies.
<br>

As proponents for real asset tokenization, it is inevitable for FinTech professionals to combine the IBREA and Chroma Way’s expected end results line by line. IBREA and Chroma Way are considered the front liners in both fields of blockchain technology and real estate. They geared towards the need for a secure process for real estate transactions and mortgage deeds.  All involved actors will have a digital file representing the agreement of ownership of the real estate, mortgage deeds and the transaction process. These files can be stored in the cloud, locally, or some other method of the actor’s choosing.  The authenticity of the process, the signatures, the file confirming ownership, mortgage deeds etc. will be secured with a blockchain. The Land Registration Office will store the blockchain with the proofs, but the blockchain will also be stored and validated by other actors. It will therefore be easy for authorized third parties to verify information. These third parties would usually be actors who are part of the process: banks, buyers, sellers, real estate agents etc.
<br>

The records and files that should be public according to local law will be public and those which should be confidential will stay confidential. There will be no bearer instrument stored on the blockchain in the current implementation. This precludes the risk of such authoritative documents being lost, stolen, or tampered with. Bearer instruments could be implemented in the future, but it should be noted that doing so entails risks and legislative uncertainties that require further investigation. The only way to steal a property is through entering a new real estate transaction process with stolen or forged identification. The security of the ID-solution can be improved according to the requirements of the system in question. More stringent identification procedures (photos of physical ID-cards, biometric identification, multi signatures, etc.) can be easily implemented.
